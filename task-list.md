How to Create Task List
=====================================================

You can create a todo like list using markdown which will be converted to a checkbox list. If you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list. It also works in Pull Requests.
```
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```
Result:
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
